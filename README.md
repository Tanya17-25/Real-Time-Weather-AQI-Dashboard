# Real-Time-Weather-AQI-Dashboard

🌦️ Just launched: My Real‑Time Weather & AQI Dashboard in Power BI! 🌍

I’ve been diving into Power BI’s capabilities, and I’m thrilled to share my latest creation—a dynamic, real‑time weather dashboard powered by WeatherAPI and enhanced with Air Quality Index (AQI) indicators.

Key highlights:

•Live weather data — Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, refreshed via WeatherAPI.
•AQI visualizations — I designed DAX measures for pollutants like PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 that dynamically compute AQI color, status, and health suggestions.
•Interactive tiles & visuals — Cards, gauges, and trend charts; city filters let viewers explore different locations.
•Custom styling — Weather icons, map visuals, and color-coded AQI cues add clarity and polish.

🔧 Tech rundown:

•Signed up on WeatherAPI and retrieved an API key.
•Connected to Power BI and loaded both weather and air_quality data.
•Expanded relevant fields, renamed columns, and shaped the dataset in Power Query.
•Crafted reusable DAX templates for AQI Color, Status, and Suggestions—just plug in the pollutant name.
•Assembled the visuals—real‑time metrics, interactive slicers, and a map‑based city selector.
•Styled everything with icons, conditional formatting, and clear, actionable insights.

🧠 Why this matters:

•Live insights help businesses, citizens, and decision‑makers act on current weather and air quality conditions.
•Templates make it easy to add new pollutants or cities—scalable and future‑proof.
•Great educational tool for exploring real‑world data in Power BI.
